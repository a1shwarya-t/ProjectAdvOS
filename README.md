 ## Introduction
 Bubble Sort and Bucket Sort are some of the sorting techniques which helps us to seperate the data according to its type, group or class. Both of these sorting techniques work for the same aim that is to sort the given list. Although they have the same aim their techniques changes accordingly i.e., the algorithms used in both of them changes.
  >Bubble Sort Method:
  The first element is compared to the second, and if the first element is greater, the elements are EXCHANGED. Repeat the process until all of the objects have been sorted.

>Bucket Sort Method:
  A bucket sort divides an unsorted array of data into many buckets. After that, each bucket is sorted using one of the proper sorting algorithms or by applying the same bucket algorithm recursively. After that, the sorted buckets are concatenated to form a sorted array.

## Requirements
* This is executed using python3 - pycharm
* snakeviz - To analyze time or space complexity of code.
* psutil - Gives information to run processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors
* plotgraph is used for visualization

## Installation

Install [python](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

## How it works
* bubbleSort.py just contains the algorithm and System usage for bubble sort
* bucketSort.py just contains the algorithm and System usage for bucket sort
* combine.py has the multiprocessing of 2 sorts
* plotting.py has the graph details
* chart.py verifies all the sorting and parallel processing techniques
